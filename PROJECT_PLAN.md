## Overview
This plan outlines the prioritized steps to transform the Cashflow Canvas Calendar into a fully functional, production-ready web application.

- Replace all dummy data (e.g., transactions, budgets, businesses) with Supabase queries/mutations.
- Implement full CRUD operations for:
  - Transactions
  - Budgets

## 4. User Management & Security

- Implement proper error feedback for all auth flows.

## 5. Testing & Quality
- Add unit and integration tests (React Testing Library, Jest).
- Add E2E tests (Cypress or Playwright).
- Set up CI for linting, type checks, and tests.

## 6. Deployment & DevOps
